/*
 
 Given a sorted array, write a simple Swift program that will determine if the array has at least 2 values that will sum up to N.
 
 Example.
 
 
 N = 8
 [2, 3, 4, 4] -> True    // This is true because we have 2 pairs that sum up to 8.
 
 N = 10
 [2, 3, 5, 6] -> False  // This is false because we don't have any pairs that will sum up to 10.

    // *** HINT ***
    // If the sum of the first and last value is greater than N, decrement the last index by one.
    // If the sum of the first and last value is less than N, increment the first index by one.
