// Step 0️⃣, create 2 variables, highestValue and lowestValue and set them to the first value of your array
// Step 1️⃣, create a for-loop that will increment throughout the array of numbers and compare each of the values to the highest and lowest value variables.
    // Challenge: What is the proper algorithm that will determine the highest and lowest value of the number array?
// Step 2️⃣, print our highest and lowest value.
